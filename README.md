# Payroll

A payroll processing system is a software and related manual procedures for paying salary and
other dues to emloyees. In a company, payroll is the sum of all the financial records of salaries
for an employee, wages, bonuses and deductions. In acocunting, payroll refers to the ampunt paid
to employees for services they provided during a certain period of time. Payroll plays a major role
in a company for several reasons.

A payroll system maintains a list of employees and also adds or deletes eployees if any new employee
joins or leaves an organization. Other employee information include name, address and phone number,
age, PAN number Employee code, Basic salary, Gross Salary and Bonus payout related details are also
maintained in the payroll system.

Some details included in a Payroll system data of an employee are as under:

- Salary Payout details:
   Dearness Allowance (DA), 
   House Rent Allowance (HRA), 
   Leave Travel Assistance (LTA), 
   Provident Fund (PF), 
   Income Tax, 
   Gross Salary, 
   Net Salary, etc.

- Service Records:
   Number of leaves taken, 
   Number of leaves left, 
   Number of years left for retirement, etc.

- Bonus Payout: based on his/her duration of employment and Performance Scale

A Payroll system also accepts the details of a new employee, registers him/her in a system and 
genertes a new record for him/her.

While it helps an employee view their individual details, the access to the system has to be 
properly secured so that no one else can se other people's details.

I have developed a Payroll system for a company using Java (BlueJ) language. The project includes
all the elements as mentioned above for processing the Payroll program.

This program has the fllowing options:

- Existing Employee
   The program contains details of five existing emloyees that can be accessed by selecting option
   for "Existing Employee" from the main menu. If the Employee code and the PAN number matches for the
   particular employee, further details such as Salary Slip, Service Record, Bonus payout, etc. can be 
   obtained according to the user's choice.

- New Employee
   One can also enter details and create a new employee through "New Employee" option in the main menu
   and get registered as an Existing Employee and then can access his/her data through "Existing Employee".
   There is also a function to return back to the main menu or to continue with the same employee or to
   Exit the system, according to the user's choice.
